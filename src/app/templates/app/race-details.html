            The Chiltern Chase is a multi-terrain run, covering 5km, 10km or
            15km. This popular course is based around the beautiful South
            Oxfordshire village of Ewelme. Runners enjoy picturesque bridleways
            and rugged trails of the Chiltern Way, accompanied by red kites
            overhead and occasional hare and deer. Running for over 17 years,
            The Chiltern Chase has raised over £100,000 for charity, and is
            managed by an experienced committee and supportive marshals.
            Refreshments are provided by Ewelme School PTA, so join us in a
            great day out for both runners and supporters alike.

          Condition of the course and race cancellation
        </h4>
        <p>
          The course is safe, albeit hilly, however in the event of a deluge or
          snow, prior to or during the event, things could get a little slippery
          on some of the off-road sections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please take extra care on the off-road sections and be mindful of
          other runners.
        </p>
        <p>
          We regret that we cannot offer refunds if the race is cancelled due to
          extreme conditions as we will have already incurred all our running
          costs. As we organise the race to support local and national charities
          we ask for your understanding and support.
        </p>
        <p>
          The likelihood of the race being cancelled due to extreme conditions
          in June is about as likely as a smooth Brexit but you never know.

            <li>
              The 10k run starts on the Common, turns right onto a road on a
              slight incline, it soon descends then levels out.
            </li>
            <li>
              After about 1.5km the course turns sharp left before climbing
              slightly & then descending to another road.
            </li>
            <li>
              A short section of road is followed by a long gentle incline
              beside a beech wood before opening up onto a wide track
            </li>
            <li>
              The first water station is approximately 4K into the course after
              which you turn left onto "set aside" land at the margins of a
              field.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once through the field gate you turn left and then left again onto
              another wide track and the course gentle descends to the next
              water station at approximately 6.5K
            </li>
            <li>
              After the water station there is a short hill just before the 7k
              mark, the course then descends gently on a gravel track before
              changing to a narrow single track section
            </li>
            <li>
              At the 8k point there is narrow gateway followed by a short field
              section which brings you back into Ewelme
            </li>
            <li>
              The last 1.5km of the course is via a narrow track and ultimately
              the main street of Ewelme before leading back to the finish on the
              Common

              same route for the first 0.5km
            </li>
            <li>It then turns left & remains on road for about another km</li>
            <li>
              It then turns left onto an off road section before joining the 10k
              route just before the 7k marker (2k mark for the 5k race)
            </li>
            <li>
              The rest of the course is the same as the 10k finishing at the
