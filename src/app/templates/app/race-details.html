          Condition of the course and race cancellation
        </h4>
        <p>
          The course is safe, albeit hilly, however in the event of a deluge or
          snow, prior to or during the event, things could get a little slippery
          on some of the off-road sections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please take extra care on the off-road sections and be mindful of
          other runners.
        </p>
        <p>
          We regret that we cannot offer refunds if the race is cancelled due to
          extreme conditions as we will have already incurred all our running
          costs. As we organise the race to support local and national charities
          we ask for your understanding and support.
        </p>
        <p>
          The likelihood of the race being cancelled due to extreme conditions
          in June is about as likely as a smooth Brexit but you never know.

            <li>
              After the water station there is a short hill just before the 7k
              mark, the course then descends gently on a gravel track before
              changing to a narrow single track section
            </li>
            <li>
              At the 8k point there is narrow gateway followed by a short field
              section which brings you back into Ewelme
            </li>
            <li>
              The last 1.5km of the course is via a narrow track and ultimately
              the main street of Ewelme before leading back to the finish on the
              Common
